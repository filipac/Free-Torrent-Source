Note though that if you didn't receive the email the first time it will probably not

<b>So, what's MY ratio?</b><a name="#17" id="17"></a>
<br />
<br />
Click on your <a class=altlink href=usercp.php>profile</a>, then on your user name (at the top).<br>
<br>
It's important to distinguish between your overall ratio and the individual ratio on each torrent
you may be seeding or leeching. The overall ratio takes into account the total uploaded and downloaded
from your account since you joined the site. The individual ratio takes into account those values for each torrent.<br>
<br>
You may see two symbols instead of a number: "Inf.", which is just an abbreviation for Infinity, and
means that you have downloaded 0 bytes while uploading a non-zero amount (ul/dl becomes infinity); "---",
which should be read as "non-available", and shows up when you have both downloaded and uploaded 0 bytes
(ul/dl = 0/0 which is an indeterminate amount).
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Why is my IP displayed on my details page?</b><a name="#18" id="18"></a>
<br />
<br />
Only you and the site moderators can view your IP address and email. Regular users do not see that information.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Help! I cannot login!? (a.k.a. Login of Death)</b><a name="#19" id="19"></a>
<br />
<br />
This problem sometimes occurs with MSIE. Close all Internet Explorer windows and open Internet Options in the control panel. Click the Delete Cookies button. You should now be able to login.

<br /><br />
<br />
<b>My IP address is dynamic. How do I stay logged in?</b><a name="#20" id="20"></a>
<br />
<br />
You do not have to anymore. All you have to do is make sure you are logged in with your actual
IP when starting a torrent session. After that, even if the IP changes mid-session,
the seeding or leeching will continue and the statistics will update without any problem.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Why is my port number reported as "---"? (And why should I care?)</b><a name="#21" id="21"></a>
<br />
<br />
The tracker has determined that you are firewalled or NATed and cannot accept incoming connections.
<br>
<br>
This means that other peers in the swarm will be unable to connect to you, only you to them. Even worse,
if two peers are both in this state they will not be able to connect at all. This has obviously a
detrimental effect on the overall speed.
<br>
<br>
The way to solve the problem involves opening the ports used for incoming connections
(the same range you defined in your client) on the firewall and/or configuring your
NAT server to use a basic form of NAT
for that range instead of NAPT (the actual process differs widely between different router models.
Check your router documentation and/or support forum. You will also find lots of information on the
subject at <a class=altlink href="http://portforward.com/">PortForward</a>).

First, find an image that you like, and that is within the

to find a place to host it, such as our own <a class=altlink href=bitbucket-upload.php>BitBucket</a>.
(Other popular choices are <a class="altlink" href="http://photobucket.com/">Photobucket</a>,
<a class="altlink" href="http://uploadit.org/">Upload-It!</a> or
<a class="altlink" href="http://www.imageshack.us/">ImageShack</a>).
All that is left to do is copy the URL you were given when
uploading it to the avatar field in your <a class="altlink" href="usercp.php">profile</a>.<br>
<br>
Please do not make a post just to test your avatar. If everything is allright you'll see it
in your details page.

<h2>Stats - <a href="#top">Top</a></h2>
<table width=737 border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td>
<a name="#3" id="3"></a>
<br />
<b>Most common reason for stats not updating</b><a name="#27" id="27"></a>
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>The user is cheating. (a.k.a. "Summary Ban")</li>
<li>The server is overloaded and unresponsive. Just try to keep the session open until the server responds again. (Flooding the server with consecutive manual updates is not recommended.)</li>
<li>You are using a faulty client. If you want to use an experimental or CVS version you do it at your own risk.</li>
</ul>
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Best practices</b><a name="#28" id="28"></a>
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>If a torrent you are currently leeching/seeding is not listed on your profile, just wait or force a manual update.</li>
<li>Make sure you exit your client properly, so that the tracker receives "event=completed".</li>
<li>If the tracker is down, do not stop seeding. As long as the tracker is back up before you exit the client the stats should update properly.</li>
</ul>
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>May I use any bittorrent client?</b><a name="#29" id="29"></a>
<br />
<br />
Yes. The tracker now updates the stats correctly for all bittorrent clients. However, we still recommend
that you <b>avoid</b> the following clients:<br>
<ul>
<li>UTorrent</li>
<li>Azerus</li>
</ul>
These clients do not report correctly to the tracker when canceling/finishing a torrent session.
If you use them then a few MB may not be counted towards
the stats near the end, and torrents may still be listed in your profile for some time after you have closed the client.<br>
<br>
Also, clients in alpha or beta version should be avoided.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Why is a torrent I'm leeching/seeding listed several times in my profile?</b><a name="#30" id="30"></a>
<br />
<br />
If for some reason (e.g. pc crash, or frozen client) your client exits improperly and you restart it,
it will have a new peer_id, so it will show as a new torrent. The old one will never receive a "event=completed"
or "event=stopped" and will be listed until some tracker timeout. Just ignore it, it will eventually go away.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>I've finished or cancelled a torrent. Why is it still listed in my profile?</b><a name="#31" id="31"></a>
<br />
<br />
Some clients, notably TorrentStorm and Nova Torrent, do not report properly to the tracker when canceling or finishing a torrent.
In that case the tracker will keep waiting for some message - and thus listing the torrent as seeding or leeching - until some
timeout occurs. Just ignore it, it will eventually go away.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Why do I sometimes see torrents I'm not leeching in my profile!?</b><a name="#32" id="32"></a>
<br />
<br />
When a torrent is first started, the tracker uses the IP to identify the user. Therefore the torrent will
become associated with the user <i>who last accessed the site</i> from that IP. If you share your IP in some
way (you are behind NAT/ICS, or using a proxy), and some of the persons you share it with are also users,
you may occasionally see their torrents listed in your profile. (If they start a torrent session from that
IP and you were the last one to visit the site the torrent will be associated with you). Note that now
torrents listed in your profile will always count towards your total stats.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Multiple IPs (Can I login from different computers?)</b><a name="#33" id="33"></a>
<br />
<br />
Yes, the tracker is now capable of following sessions from different IPs for the same user. A torrent is associated with the user when it starts, and only at that moment is the IP relevant. So if you want to seed/leech from computer A and computer B with the same account you should access the site from computer A, start the torrent there, and then repeat both steps from computer B (not limited to two computers or to a single torrent on each, this is just the simplest example). You do not need to login again when closing the torrent.

<br /><br />
<br />
<b>How does NAT/ICS change the picture?</b><a name="#34" id="34"></a>
<br />
<br />
This is a very particular case in that all computers in the LAN will appear to the outside world as having the same IP. We must distinguish
between two cases:<br>
<br>
<b>1.</b> <i>You are the single Template Shares users in the LAN</i><br>
<br>
You should use the same Template Shares account in all the computers.<br>
<br>
Note also that in the ICS case it is preferable to run the BT client on the ICS gateway. Clients running on the other computers
will be unconnectable (their ports will be listed as "---", as explained elsewhere in the FAQ) unless you specify
the appropriate services in your ICS configuration (a good explanation of how to do this for Windows XP can be found
<a class=altlink href="redirect.php?url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1dcff3ce-f50f-4a34-ae67-cac31ccd7bc9&displaylang=en">here</a>).
In the NAT case you should configure different ranges for clients on different computers and create appropriate NAT rules in the router. (Details vary widely from router to router and are outside the scope of this FAQ. Check your router documentation and/or support forum.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b> <i>There are multiple Template Shares users in the LAN</i><br>
<br>
At present there is no way of making this setup always work properly with Template Shares.
Each torrent will be associated with the user who last accessed the site from within
the LAN before the torrent was started.
Unless there is cooperation between the users mixing of statistics is possible.
(User A accesses the site, downloads a .torrent file, but does not start the torrent immediately.
Meanwhile, user B accesses the site. User A then starts the torrent. The torrent will count
towards user B's statistics, not user A's.)
<br>

It is your LAN, the responsibility is yours. Do not ask us to ban other users
with the same IP, we will not do that. (Why should we ban <i>him</i> instead of <i>you</i>?)

<b>Can I upload your torrents to other trackers?</b><a name="#38" id="38"></a>
<br />
<br />
No. We are a closed, limited-membership community. Only registered users can use the TB tracker.
Posting our torrents on other trackers is useless, since most people who attempt to download them will
be unable to connect with us. This generates a lot of frustration and bad-will against us at Template Shares,
and will therefore not be tolerated.<br>
<br>
Complaints from other sites' administrative staff about our torrents being posted on their sites will
result in the banning of the users responsible.<br>
<br>
(However, the files you download from us are yours to do as you please. You can always create another
torrent, pointing to some other tracker, and upload it to the site of your choice.)

<br />
<b>Why did an active torrent suddenly disappear?</b><a name="#41" id="41"></a>
<br />
<br />
There may be three reasons for this:<br>
(<b>1</b>) The torrent may have been out-of-sync with the site
<a class=altlink href=rules.php>rules</a>.<br>
(<b>2</b>) The uploader may have deleted it because it was a bad release.
A replacement will probably be uploaded to take its place.<br>
(<b>3</b>) Torrents are automatically deleted after 28 days.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>How do I resume a broken download or reseed something?</b><a name="#42" id="42"></a>
<br />
<br />
Open the .torrent file. When your client asks you for a location, choose the location of the existing file(s) and it will resume/reseed the torrent.

<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Why do my downloads sometimes stall at 99%?</b><a name="#43" id="43"></a>
<br />
<br />
The more pieces you have, the harder it becomes to find peers who have pieces you are missing. That is why downloads sometimes slow down or even stall when there are just a few percent remaining. Just be patient and you will, sooner or later, get the remaining pieces.

<br /><br />
<br />
<b>What are these "a piece has failed an hash check" messages?</b><a name="#44" id="44"></a>
<br />
<br />
Bittorrent clients check the data they receive for integrity. When a piece fails this check it is
automatically re-downloaded. Occasional hash fails are a common occurrence, and you shouldn't worry.<br>
<br>
Some clients have an (advanced) option/preference to 'kick/ban clients that send you bad data' or
similar. It should be turned on, since it makes sure that if a peer repeatedly sends you pieces that
fail the hash check it will be ignored in the future.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>The torrent is supposed to be 100MB. How come I downloaded 120MB?</b><a name="#45" id="45"></a>
<br />
<br />
See the hash fails topic. If your client receives bad data it will have to redownload it, therefore
the total downloaded may be larger than the torrent size. Make sure the "kick/ban" option is turned on
to minimize the extra downloads.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Why do I get a "Not authorized (xx h) - READ THE FAQ" error?</b><a name="#46" id="46"></a>
<br />
<br />
From the time that each <b>new</b> torrent is uploaded to the tracker, there is a period of time that
some users must wait before they can download it.<br>
This delay in downloading will only affect users with a low ratio, and users with low upload amounts.<br>

"<b>And/or</b>" means any or both. Your delay will be the <b>largest</b> one for which you meet <b>at least</b> one condition.<br>
<br>
This applies to new users as well, so opening a new account will not help. Note also that this
works at tracker level, you will be able to grab the .torrent file itself at any time.<br>
<br>
<!--The delay applies only to leeching, not to seeding. If you got the files from any other source and
wish to seed them you may do so at any time irrespectively of your ratio or total uploaded.<br>-->
N.B. Due to some users exploiting the 'no-delay-for-seeders' policy we had to change it. The delay
now applies to both seeding and leeching. So if you are subject to a delay and get the files from
some other source you will not be able to seed them until the delay has elapsed.

<br />
<b>Why do I get a "rejected by tracker - Port xxxx is blacklisted" error?</b><a name="#47" id="47"></a>
<br />
<br />
Your client is reporting to the tracker that it uses one of the default bittorrent ports
(6881-6889) or any other common p2p port for incoming connections.<br>
<br>
Template Shares does not allow clients to use ports commonly associated with p2p protocols.
The reason for this is that it is a common practice for ISPs to throttle those ports
(that is, limit the bandwidth, hence the speed). <br>
<br>
The blocked ports list include, but is not neccessarily limited to, the following:<br>
<br>
<table cellspacing=3 cellpadding=0>
  <tr>
	<td class=embedded width="80">Direct Connect</td>

</table>
<br>
In order to use use our tracker you must  configure your client to use
any port range that does not contain those ports (a range within the region 49152 through 65535 is preferable,
cf. <a class=altlink href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers">IANA</a>). Notice that some clients,
like Azureus 2.0.7.0 or higher, use a single port for all torrents, while most others use one port per open torrent. The size
of the range you choose should take this into account (typically less than 10 ports wide. There
is no benefit whatsoever in choosing a wide range, and there are possible security implications). <br>
<br>
These ports are used for connections between peers, not client to tracker.
Therefore this change will not interfere with your ability to use other trackers (in fact it
should <i>increase</i> your speed with torrents from any tracker, not just ours). Your client
will also still be able to connect to peers that are using the standard ports.
If your client does not allow custom ports to be used, you will have to switch to one that does.<br>
<br>
Do not ask us, or in the forums, which ports you should choose. The more random the choice is the harder
it will be for ISPs to catch on to us and start limiting speeds on the ports we use.
If we simply define another range ISPs will start throttling that range also. <br>
<br>
Finally, remember to forward the chosen ports in your router and/or open them in your
firewall, should you have them.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>What's this "IOError - [Errno13] Permission denied" error?</b><a name="#48" id="48"></a>
<br />
<br />
If you just want to fix it reboot your computer, it should solve the problem.
Otherwise read on.<br>
<br>
IOError means Input-Output Error, and that is a file system error, not a tracker one.
It shows up when your client is for some reason unable to open the partially downloaded
torrent files. The most common cause is two instances of the client to be running
simultaneously:
the last time the client was closed it somehow didn't really close but kept running in the
background, and is therefore still
locking the files, making it impossible for the new instance to open them.<br>
<br>
A more uncommon occurrence is a corrupted FAT. A crash may result in corruption
that makes the partially downloaded files unreadable, and the error ensues. Running
scandisk should solve the problem. (Note that this may happen only if you're running
Windows 9x - which only support FAT - or NT/2000/XP with FAT formatted hard drives.
NTFS is much more robust and should never permit this problem.)
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>What's this "TTL" in the browse page?</b><a name="#49" id="49"></a>
<br />
<br />
The torrent's Time To Live, in hours. It means the torrent will be deleted
from the tracker after that many hours have elapsed (yes, even if it is still active).
Note that this a maximum value, the torrent may be deleted at any time if it's inactive.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Why do I get a "Not authorized (You are downloading your maximum number of allowed torrents - x)" error ?</b><a name="#66" id="66"></a>
<br />
<br />
This is part of the "Slot System". The slot system is being used to limit the concurrent downloads for users that have ratio below 0.95 and uploaded < 9.5 gb<br><br>
In detail: <br><br>
Users with ratio < 0.5 / Uploaded < 5 gb have only 1 download slot available <br>
Users with ratio < 0.65 / Uploaded < 6.5 gb have only 2 download slots available <br>
Users with ratio < 0.8 / Uploaded < 8 gb have only 3 download slots available <br>
Users with ratio < 0.95 / Uploaded < 9.5 gb have only 4 download slots available <br>
Users with ratio > 0.95 / Uploaded > 9.5 gb have unlimited download slots <br><br>
In all cases the seeding slots are unlimited. However if you have already filled all your available download slots and try to start seeding you will receive the same error. In this case you must free at least one download slot in order to start all your seeds and then start the download. If all your download slots are filled the system will deny any connection before validating if you want to download or seed. So first start your seeds and after that your downloads. <br>
<br><br>
In any time, you can check your available slots in the member bar on top of the page <br><br>
You should also know that the slots for every user are calculated every 30min. Which means that if you cross a ratio barrier for more or less slots the tracker will need up to 30 min to be informed of this change, inspite of the maximum slots that you can see on your member bar.<br>
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>What is the passkey System? How does it work? </b><a name="#67" id="67"></a>
<br />
<br />
The passkey system has been implemented in order to substitute the ip checking system. This means that the tracker doesnt check anymore your logged ip in order to verify if you are logged in or registered with the tracker. Every user has a personal passkey, a random key generated by the system. When a user tries to download a torrent, its personal passkey is imprinted in the tracker url of the torrent, allowing to the tracker to identify any source connected on it. In this way, you can seed a torrent for example, at home and at your office simultaneously without any problem with the 2 different ips. Per torrent 3 simultaneous connections are permitted per user, and in case of leeching only 1 (That means you can leech a torrent from one location only at a time.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Why do i get a "Unknown Passkey" error? </b><a name="#68" id="68"></a>
<br />
<br />
You will get this error, firstly if you are not registered on our tracker, or if you havent downloaded the torrent to use from our webpage, when you were logged in. In this case, just register or log in and redownload the torrent.

There is a chance to get this error also, at the first time you download anything as a new user, or at the first download after you reset your passkey. The reason is simply that the tracker reviews the changes in the passkeys every few minutes and not instantly. For that reason just leave the torrent running for a few minutes, and you will get eventually an OK message from the tracker.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>When do i need to reset my passkey? </b><a name="#69" id="69"></a>
<br />
<br />
<ul><li> If your passkey has been leeched and other user(s) uses it to download torrents using your account. In this case, you will see torrents stated in your account that you are not leeching or seeding .</li>
<li> When your clients hangs up or your connection is terminated without pressing the stop button of your client. In this case, in your account you will see that you are still leeching/seeding the torrents even that your client has been closed. Normally these "ghost peers" will be cleaned automatically within 30 minutes, but if you want to resume your downloads and the tracker denied that due to the fact that you "already are downloading the same torrents - Connection limit error" then you should reset your passkey and redownload the torrent, then resume it. </li></ul>
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>What is DHT and Why must i turn it off?</b><a name="#70" id="70"></a>
<br />
<br />
DHT must be disabled in your client, DHT can cause your stats to be recorded incorrectly and could be seen as cheating also disable PEX (peer exchange) Anyone using this will be banned for cheating the system. Check your snatchlist regularly to ensure stats are being recorded correctly, allow 30mins for the tracker to update your stats.

<h2>How can I improve my download speed? - <a href="#top">Top</a></h2>
<table width=737 border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td>
<a name="#6" id="6"></a>
<br />
<b>Do not immediately jump on new torrents</b><a name="#50" id="50"></a>
<br />
<br />
The download speed mostly depends on the seeder-to-leecher ratio (SLR). Poor download speed is
mainly a problem with new and very popular torrents where the SLR is low.<br>
<br>
(Proselytising sidenote: make sure you remember that you did not enjoy the low speed.
<b>Seed</b> so that others will not endure the same.)<br>
<br>
There are a couple of things that you can try on your end to improve your speed:<br>
<br>In particular, do not do it if you have a slow connection. The best speeds will be found around the
half-life of a torrent, when the SLR will be at its highest. (The downside is that you will not be able to seed
so much. It's up to you to balance the pros and cons of this.)
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Limit your upload speed</b><a name="#51" id="51"></a>
<br />
<br />
The upload speed affects the download speed in essentially two ways:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Bittorrent peers tend to favour those other peers that upload to them. This means that if A and B
	are leeching the same torrent and A is sending data to B at high speed then B will try to reciprocate.
	So due to this effect high upload speeds lead to high download speeds.</li>

    <li>Due to the way TCP works, when A is downloading something from B it has to keep telling B that
        it received the data sent to him. (These are called acknowledgements - ACKs -, a sort of "got it!" messages).
        If A fails to do this then B will stop sending data and wait. If A is uploading at full speed there may be no
        bandwidth left for the ACKs and they will be delayed. So due to this effect excessively high upload speeds lead
        to low download speeds.</li>
</ul>

The full effect is a combination of the two. The upload should be kept as high as possible while allowing the
ACKs to get through without delay. <b>A good thumb rule is keeping the upload at about 80% of the theoretical
upload speed.</b> You will have to fine tune yours to find out what works best for you. (Remember that keeping the
upload high has the additional benefit of helping with your ratio.) <br>
<br>
If you are running more than one instance of a client it is the overall upload speed that you must take into account.
Some clients (e.g. Azureus) limit global upload speed, others (e.g. Shad0w's) do it on a per torrent basis.
Know your client. The same applies if you are using your connection for anything else (e.g. browsing or ftp),
always think of the overall upload speed.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Limit the number of simultaneous connections</b><a name="#52" id="52"></a>
<br />
<br />
Some operating systems (like Windows 9x) do not deal well with a large number of connections, and may even crash.
Also some home routers (particularly when running NAT and/or firewall with stateful inspection services) tend to become
slow or crash when having to deal with too many connections. There are no fixed values for this, you may try 60 or 100
and experiment with the value. Note that these numbers are additive, if you have two instances of
a client running the numbers add up.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Limit the number of simultaneous uploads</b><a name="#53" id="53"></a>
<br />
<br />
Isn't this the same as above? No. Connections limit the number of peers your client is talking to and/or
downloading from. Uploads limit the number of peers your client is actually uploading to. The ideal number is
typically much lower than the number of connections, and highly dependent on your (physical) connection.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Just give it some time</b><a name="#54" id="54"></a>
<br />
<br />
As explained above peers favour other peers that upload to them. When you start leeching a new torrent you have
nothing to offer to other peers and they will tend to ignore you. This makes the starts slow, in particular if,
by change, the peers you are connected to include few or no seeders. The download speed should increase as soon
as you have some pieces to share.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Why is my browsing so slow while leeching?</b><a name="#55" id="55"></a>
<br />
<br />
Your download speed is always finite. If you are a peer in a fast torrent it will almost certainly saturate your
download bandwidth, and your browsing will suffer. At the moment there is no client that allows you to limit the
download speed, only the upload. You will have to use a third-party solution,
such as <a class=altlink href="redirect.php?url=http://www.netlimiter.com/">NetLimiter</a>.<br>
<br>
Browsing was used just as an example, the same would apply to gaming, IMing, etc...

<b>What is a proxy?</b><a name="#56" id="56"></a>

Basically a middleman. When you are browsing a site through a proxy your requests are sent to the proxy and the proxy

</table>
<br>
A transparent proxy may or may not be anonymous, and there are several levels of anonymity.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>How do I find out if I'm behind a (transparent/anonymous) proxy?</b><a name="#57" id="57"></a>
<br />
<br />
Try <a href=http://proxyjudge.org class="altlink">ProxyJudge</a>. It lists the HTTP headers that the server where it is running
received from you. The relevant ones are HTTP_CLIENT_IP, HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR and REMOTE_ADDR.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Why is my port listed as "---" even though I'm not NAT/Firewalled?</b><a name="prox3"></a><br>
<br>
The Template Shares tracker is quite smart at finding your real IP, but it does need the proxy to send the HTTP header
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR. If your ISP's proxy does not then what happens is that the tracker will interpret the proxy's IP
address as the client's IP address. So when you login and the tracker tries to connect to your client to see if you are
NAT/firewalled it will actually try to connect to the proxy on the port your client reports to be using for
incoming connections. Naturally the proxy will not be listening on that port, the connection will fail and the
tracker will think you are NAT/firewalled.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Can I bypass my ISP's proxy?</b><a name="#58" id="58"></a>
<br />
<br />
If your ISP only allows HTTP traffic through port 80 or blocks the usual proxy ports then you would need to use something
like <a href=http://www.socks.permeo.com>socks</a> and that is outside the scope of this FAQ.<br>
<br>
The site accepts connections on port 81 besides the usual 80, and using them may be enough to fool some proxies. So the first
thing to try should be connecting to www.templateshares.net:81. Note that even if this works your bt client will still try
to connect to port 80 unless you edit the announce url in the .torrent file.<br>
<br>
Otherwise you may try the following:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Choose any public <b>non-anonymous</b> proxy that does <b>not</b> use port 80
	(e.g. from <a href=http://tools.rosinstrument.com/proxy  class="altlink">this</a>,
	<a href=http://www.proxy4free.com/index.html  class="altlink">this</a> or
	<a href=http://www.samair.ru/proxy  class="altlink">this</a> list).</li>

    <li>Configure your computer to use that proxy. For Windows XP, do <i>Start</i>, <i>Control Panel</i>, <i>Internet Options</i>,
	<i>Connections</i>, <i>LAN Settings</i>, <i>Use a Proxy server</i>, <i>Advanced</i> and type in the IP and port of your chosen
	proxy. Or from Internet Explorer use <i>Tools</i>, <i>Internet Options</i>, ...<br></li>

    <li>(Facultative) Visit <a href=http://proxyjudge.org  class="altlink">ProxyJudge</a>. If you see an HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR in
	the list followed by your IP then everything should be ok, otherwise choose another proxy and try again.<br></li>

    <li>Visit Template Shares. Hopefully the tracker will now pickup your real IP (check your profile to make sure).</li>
</ul>
<br>
Notice that now you will be doing all your browsing through a public proxy, which are typically quite slow.
Communications between peers do not use port 80 so their speed will not be affected by this, and should be better than when
you were "unconnectable".

<b>How do I make my bittorrent client use a proxy?</b><a name="#59" id="59"></a>
<br />
<br />
Just configure Windows XP as above. When you configure a proxy for Internet Explorer you're actually configuring a proxy for
all HTTP traffic (thank Microsoft and their "IE as part of the OS policy" ). On the other hand if you use another
browser (Opera/Mozilla/Firefox) and configure a proxy there you'll be configuring a proxy just for that browser. We don't
know of any BT client that allows a proxy to be specified explicitly.

<b>Why can't I signup from behind a proxy?</b><a name="#60" id="60"></a>
<br />
<br />
It is our policy not to allow new accounts to be opened from behind a proxy.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Does this apply to other torrent sites?</b><a name="#61" id="61"></a>
<br />
<br />
This section was written for Template Shares, a closed, port 80-81 tracker. Other trackers may be open or closed, and many listen
on e.g. ports 6868 or 6969. The above does <b>not</b> necessarily apply to other trackers.

<h2>Why can't I connect? Is the site blocking me? - <a href="#top">Top</a></h2>

<br />
<br />
The site blocks addresses listed in the (former) <a class=altlink href="http://methlabs.org/">PeerGuardian</a>
database, as well as addresses of banned users. This works at Apache/PHP level, it's just a script that
blocks <i>logins</i> from those addresses. It should not stop you from reaching the site. In particular
it does not block lower level protocols, you should be able to ping/traceroute the server even if your
address is blacklisted. If you cannot then the reason for the problem lies elsewhere.<br>
<br>
If somehow your address is indeed blocked in the PG database do not contact us about it, it is not our
policy to open <i>ad hoc</i> exceptions. You should clear your IP with the database maintainers instead.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Your ISP blocks the site's address</b><a name="#63" id="63"></a>
<br />
<br />
(In first place, it's unlikely your ISP is doing so. DNS name resolution and/or network problems are the usual culprits.)
<br>
There's nothing we can do.
You should contact your ISP (or get a new one). Note that you can still visit the site via a proxy, follow the instructions
in the relevant section. In this case it doesn't matter if the proxy is anonymous or not, or which port it listens to.<br>
<br>
Notice that you will always be listed as an "unconnectable" client because the tracker will be unable to
check that you're capable of accepting incoming connections.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Alternate port (81)</b><a name="#64" id="64"></a>
<br />
<br />
Some of our torrents use ports other than the usual HTTP port 80. This may cause problems for some users,
for instance those behind some firewall or proxy configurations.

You can easily solve this by editing the .torrent file yourself with any torrent editor, e.g.
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/burst/" class="altlink">MakeTorrent</a>,
and replacing the announce url templateshares.net:81 with templateshares.net:80 or just templateshares.net.<br>
<br>
Editing the .torrent with Notepad is not recommended. It may look like a text file, but it is in fact
a bencoded file. If for some reason you must use a plain text editor, change the announce url to
templateshares.net:80, not templateshares.net. (If you're thinking about changing the number before the
announce url instead, you know too much to be reading this.)

Post in the <a class="altlink" href="forums">Forums</a>, by all means. You'll find they
are usually a friendly and helpful place,
provided you follow a few basic guidelines:
<ul>
<li>Make sure your problem is not really in this FAQ. There's no point in posting just to be sent
back here.
<li>Before posting read the sticky topics (the ones at the top). Many times new information that
still hasn't been incorporated in the FAQ can be found there.</li>
<li>Help us in helping you. Do not just say "it doesn't work!". Provide details so that we don't
have to guess or waste time asking. What client do you use? What's your OS? What's your network setup? What's the exact
error message you get, if any? What are the torrents you are having problems with? The more
you tell the easiest it will be for us, and the more probable your post will get a reply.</li>
<li>And needless to say: be polite. Demanding help rarely works, asking for it usually does
the trick.
