Although the word <b>cheat</b> is used here, it should be kept in mind that this<br>
is statistical analysis - "There are lies, damm lies, and statistics!"<br>
The value for cheating can and will change quite drastically depending on what<br>
is happening, so you should always take into account other factors before<br>
issueing a warning.<br>
Somebody might get quite a high cheat value, but never cheat in their life - simply<br>
from bad luck in when the client updates the tracker - but that will drop again in<br>
the future. A true cheater will stay consistantly high...
